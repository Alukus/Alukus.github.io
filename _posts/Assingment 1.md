This script loads a geochemical dataset from Excel and produces a four-panel figure where the first three plots show elemental relationships (As–Sb, Fe–Zn, Cu–Ag) with Pearson correlation coefficients added directly on each subplot, while the fourth plot converts Sb–As and Fe–Zn data into apfu ratios to classify samples into Ten-(Fe), Ten-(Zn), Tet-(Fe), and Tet-(Zn).
